- 👋 Hi, I’m Seif Sekalala (handle: @dibleauzah)
- 👀 I’m interested in web-development, project-management, data-science, and communication/social-science research.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and/or continuosly honing my knowledge in areas such as (among others): 1)--Basic front-end web-development via HMTL, CSS & JavaScript, 2)--General full-stack web-development. Particular areas of focus: JavaScript-based stacks (e.g. MERN/MEAN), 3)--Algorithmns and data-structures,  and 4)--Python for data-science and backend operations, and other backend languages (e.g. Java), 5)--Other necessary libraries, frameworks, and tools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can help me keep honing my skills, e.g. my work as PM and software-development apprentice with the PHLASK project--please refer to the relevant repo for details!
- 📫 How to reach me: dibleauzah@gmail.com, or "Seif Sekalala" on LinkedIn! :-)
